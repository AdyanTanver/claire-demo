# Clarity Labs

## About
Clarity Labs is building AI-powered insurance management for businesses. We make commercial insurance simple and autonomous.

## Problem
Most businesses don't go out of their way to buy insurance — it's something they have to do to win contracts, sign leases, or operate in a state. The process of buying and managing insurance is terrible. Few companies have an in-house insurance expert. The critical job of buying, managing, renewing, and handling claims falls on someone who never signed up for it.

## Product
Our first product is called Claire. Claire is an AI system of record for your insurance that understands not just where your policies are, but what they mean — what you're covered for, where you have gaps, when you need to act, and what it'll cost you if you don't.

Claire lives in your email inbox and SMS — answering your customers' due diligence questions, sending COIs to your landlord when you sign a new lease, and helping you file claims when things go wrong. Claire can proactively recommend changes, flag coverage gaps, and help you buy or renew policies completely autonomously.

## Distribution
We partner with insurance brokers to bring Claire to businesses. Brokers give their clients a dedicated intelligence layer that understands their coverage, answers their questions, and acts on their behalf — all without any added work.
